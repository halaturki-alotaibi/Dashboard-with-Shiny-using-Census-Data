# ðŸŽ¯ Census Demographics Explorer - Shiny Dashboard

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

my task is to support the **marketing team** with **data-driven insights**.

The marketing team operates on a **tight budget** and wants to know **which demographics in the US (age, education, gender, etc.) to focus their advertisements on**.

Using **US Census data**, this interactive **Shiny dashboard** helps explore key demographic patterns to guide strategic marketing decisions.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

The dataset used is the **Adult Income Census dataset** sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult). It includes the following features:

- `age`, `education`, `marital_status`, `occupation`, `relationship`, `race`, `sex`, `capital_gain`, `capital_loss`, `hours_per_week`, `native_country`, and an income **prediction** column (`prediction`) which indicates whether a person earns `<=50K` or `>50K`.

## ðŸ’¡ Objective

The goal of the dashboard is to:

- Explore **demographic trends** across different countries and income groups.
- Allow marketing teams to **interactively analyze** which demographic segments (e.g., women with college education aged 30-40) are more likely to earn higher or lower income.
- Help focus marketing efforts on **high-potential, underserved groups** in the US.
